# AIDA Pickup Skill

## Purpose

Drive the implementer / reviewer / triage / architect loop where the active
role pulls the next item from the queue, works on it, marks it complete,
and pulls the next. Pairs with the `advisor` role — the **advisor** seat —
on the producer side (see `aida role enter advisor` and
`aida queue add --for <role>`).

## When to use

- The user is in a doer role (implementer, reviewer, etc.) and asks
  "what's next?" or "pick up the next task"
- After completing a piece of work — proactively offer to grab the next
  item from the queue
- At the start of a focused work session — show what's queued before
  the user dives in

## Skip if

- No role is active (`AIDA_SESSION_ROLE` empty) — suggest
  `eval "$(aida role enter <name>)"` first so the queue filter has a target
  (or the `aida-role <name>` shell helper if `aida dev shell-init --install`
  has been run)
- The user is in `advisor` mode (the advisor seat) — that's the producer
  seat, not the consumer

## Your local scratchpad is NOT AIDA substrate (BUG-378)

If you are an agent with an internal session file (`task.md`,
`walkthrough.md`, `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<id>/task.md`, Codex's
internal todo, etc.), **your scratchpad is a private working draft, not
ground truth**. It does NOT auto-sync with AIDA's brief surface, the queue,
or the spec store. Re-reading your own scratchpad to figure out what to do
next is the **scratchpad-drift failure mode** — the agent loops on stale
local state and re-renders "all done" while new work sits unread in the
brief queue.

Authoritative state lives in:

- `aida queue next` / `aida queue list --for <role>` — the role's work queue
- `aida brief list --for-agent <type>` — pending briefs filed for your agent type
- `aida show <SPEC-ID>` — the spec's current contract

At every work-cycle boundary (start of a pickup, after a finish, before
declaring "done"), poll the substrate — not your scratchpad. The
**substrate-as-bouncer** gate added by BUG-378 will print a loud
`NEW BRIEF(S) PENDING` banner on `aida queue done` / `aida edit --status
done|completed` if you missed a brief, but the banner is a last-line backstop:
the discipline is to poll first.

## Active role

!`echo "Role: ${AIDA_SESSION_ROLE:-(none active)}"`

## Current queue head

!`aida queue next 2>/dev/null || echo "(no items)"`

## Drain position

!`aida orchestrator status 2>/dev/null | grep -q orchestrated && aida drain status 2>/dev/null || true`

## Plan brief

!`aida session show --plan 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/Plan brief:/,$p' || true`

## Batch context

!`aida session show --plan 2>/dev/null | grep -iE '^[[:space:]]*batch:' || true`

## Pending findings

!`c=$(aida findings list --count 2>/dev/null || echo 0); [ "${c:-0}" -gt 0 ] && echo "$c findings from headless drain phases awaiting triage — run: aida findings list" || true`

## Argument forms

`/aida-pickup` takes an optional argument. **Step 2's confirm fires only
on the bare no-argument form** — every other form below carries an
explicit consent signal in the argument and skips the confirm (TASK-548):

- **(no argument)** — pick up the queue head routed to the active role.
  This is the *only* form that pauses to confirm.
- **`<SPEC-ID>`** — pick up that specific spec straight away. The
  SPEC-ID IS the commitment; the Step 3c spec card is the verification
  surface, not a confirmation prompt. trace:TASK-548
- **`--auto-first`** — launched by `aida queue work` (no-arg head mode
  or cluster mode) after its pre-flight consent summary. trace:TASK-86
- **`--batch <NAME>`** — *batch continuation*: pick up the next queued
  member of `batch:NAME` as additional commits on the **current branch**,
  without spawning a new worktree. Use it from inside an active batch
  session to drain the next item — see Step 1's *Batch continuation*
  path. It's the interactive counterpart of `aida queue work --batch NAME
  --auto-complete` (the autonomous drain). trace:TASK-272

## Autonomy mode — `$AIDA_ZEN` (STORY-287)

This skill's user-facing prompts carry a `kind:` annotation in an HTML
comment directly above each one:

- `<!-- kind:confirmation -->` — a mechanical yes/no whose default
  (option 1) is obvious: "open PR?", "merge?", "grab next item?".
- `<!-- kind:design-fork -->` — a genuine choice between meaningful
  alternatives, where guessing wrong has real cost.

Before surfacing any prompt, check the autonomy mode:

```bash
aida zen status
```

- **`zen`** — *advisor-on-standby* mode, **corroborated** (`aida queue
  work --zen`, or a live `--auto-complete --zen` orchestrator). For every
  `kind:confirmation` prompt, do **not** call `AskUserQuestion`: take
  option 1 (the first / recommended choice) and proceed, printing one
  line — `↳ zen: auto-resolved "<prompt>" → option 1`. Still surface
  every `kind:design-fork` prompt unchanged — those are the real
  questions the advisor stays at the keyboard for.
- **`interactive`** — default mode: surface every prompt, no change.
  `aida zen status` prints `interactive` whenever zen is off *or*
  `AIDA_ZEN=1` is set but its provenance cannot be corroborated — a
  stale / leaked `AIDA_ZEN=1` never silently enables zen (BUG-237).
  Branch off this word, **not** the bare `$AIDA_ZEN` env var. trace:BUG-237

A headless `--no-human` drain (`AIDA_HEADLESS=1`) is the stronger mode and
overrides `--zen`. An un-annotated prompt defaults to `design-fork`
(pause-safe). Author guidance: `docs/aida/discipline/skill-prompt-kinds.md`.
trace:STORY-287

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check the queue

Run `aida queue next` to see the top item routed to the current role.
The output includes:
- spec_id, title, status, priority, owner
- The note from whoever queued it (often the advisor seat)
- First 10 lines of the description
- Suggested follow-up commands

If the queue is empty, surface that to the user and stop. Don't fabricate
work — empty queue is a real signal.

**If the Drain position block above emitted output** (STORY-301) — this
session is a phase child of a live `aida queue work --auto-complete`
orchestrator. Lead your first message with it: it answers, *before the
user asks*, what command launched the drain, whether it is a single-spec
or a batch drain, how far through it is, and what happens to the queue
when this session exits. The user inside an orchestrator-driven session
otherwise has no way to see any of that. Stay silent when the block is
empty (no drain, or a standalone session). trace:STORY-301

**If the Pending findings block above emitted a line** (STORY-278 /
STORY-285) — a headless drain phase filed follow-ups the advisor hasn't
triaged yet: the reviewer (`from-review:`) and/or the implementer
(`from-implementer:`, Step 5b below). Surface it verbatim to the user as a
one-line nudge. Don't act on it here (triage is the advisor's job); just
make sure it isn't missed. Stay silent when the block is empty.

**If a Plan brief is shown above** (TASK-95) — `aida queue work`
pre-populated it from a matching `docs/plans/` file — lead your first
message with it: name the plan file, the Critical Files (the blast
radius), and the Verification script (the definition of done). The
implementer should not have to grep for the plan. The Followups list is
informational here; the `aida queue done` handler offers to file those as
TASKs at completion time (TASK-96).

**If the Batch context block above emitted a `batch:` line** (TASK-272) —
`aida queue work --batch NAME` set this session up to drain a batch.
Two things follow: (a) Step 6's next-steps menu uses the *Batch mode*
template so cluster-mode continuation is the primary option, and
(b) `/aida-pickup --batch <NAME>` is how you advance to the next member
without leaving this session.

#### Batch continuation (`/aida-pickup --batch <NAME>`)

When `/aida-pickup` is invoked with `--batch <NAME>` from inside an
already-active batch session, do **not** run `aida queue work` — that
spawns a sibling worktree and breaks the one-branch / one-PR cluster
shape. Instead:

1. Resolve the next queued member: `aida queue work --batch <NAME>
   --dry-run` prints the batch in pickup order; the head of that list is
   the next item. (`aida queue list --batch <NAME>` is the equivalent
   view.)
2. If the dry-run reports **no queued items**, the batch is exhausted —
   tell the user, render Step 6's *batch exhausted* path, and stop.
3. Otherwise take that head spec as `<spec_id>` and proceed through
   Steps 3b–5 (mark in-progress, render the card, do the work, commit on
   the **current branch**, `aida queue done`). Skip Step 3a — the batch
   marker is already on the manifest; there's no new cluster to record,
   and there's no per-item confirm (the batch IS the consent record).

### Step 2: Confirm pickup

<!-- kind:confirmation -->
Show the user the item and ask whether to start. Examples:

> Next up: **FR-1-042 — Add OAuth provider** (Approved · High · joe)
>
> Note from advisor: "high priority, customer ask"
>
> Want me to start on this? I'll mark it in-progress before diving in.

If the user says no (wants to skip, prioritize differently, etc.), stop
here. Don't auto-skip to the next item — the queue order encodes priority.

**Skip the confirm whenever ANY argument was passed** (TASK-548,
generalising TASK-86). The argument IS the consent signal. Three forms
reach this skill with an argument, and all three skip the Step 2 confirm:

- **`/aida-pickup <SPEC-ID>`** — operator explicitly typed the SPEC-ID
  (either `aida queue work <SPEC-ID>`, which derives this prompt, or a
  direct `/aida-pickup <SPEC-ID>` from the conversation). The SPEC-ID IS
  the commitment; re-asking *"Confirm pickup of <SPEC-ID>?"* is the
  friction-without-value TASK-548 was filed against. The spec card
  (Step 3c) is the verification surface — if the operator picked the
  wrong spec they Ctrl+C and roll back with `aida edit <SPEC-ID>
  --status approved`. trace:TASK-548
- **`/aida-pickup --auto-first`** (TASK-86) — `aida queue work` (no-arg
  head mode, or cluster mode) launched the skill after its pre-flight
  summary, which IS the consent point.
- **`/aida-pickup --batch <NAME>`** — batch continuation; the batch
  itself is the consent record (see *Batch continuation* above).

Also skip it under `$AIDA_ZEN` (STORY-287) — this is a `kind:confirmation`
prompt, so advisor-on-standby mode auto-resolves it: take "start" and
proceed straight to Step 3a/3b, printing the one-line `↳ zen:` note.

Keep the confirm **only** for the bare `/aida-pickup` invocation (no
argument, no upstream consent, default mode) — that's the one form where
the operator hasn't named anything and the skill is picking the head of
the queue on their behalf.

After the first item, you can also skip the per-item confirm when
walking a planned cluster — the manifest IS the consent record. Surface
each item briefly (one line) and move to mark-in-progress.

#### Optional: capture a pickup complexity estimate (STORY-439)

When the operator launched with `--complexity {low|med|high}` and/or
`--assist-est {none|advisor|human}`, `aida queue work` already wrote
the pickup slot to `.aida/complexity-calibration/<SPEC>.yaml` and
stamped the matching tag on the spec. **Don't re-prompt** — the
estimate is best-effort, not graded, and the capture is one operator
action, not a per-pickup gate.

If you (the implementer) read the spec and form a sharper estimate
than what was captured, mention it as a one-liner — the user can
re-stamp later with `aida edit <SPEC> --add-tag complexity:<level>`.
Never silently overwrite the operator's call.

### Step 3a: Record the planned cluster (STORY-98)

If the user's confirmation covers MORE than one item — i.e. they want
you to work a multi-item batch ("do all of TASK-67 through TASK-74",
"work STORY-98 + STORY-90 + BUG-74", etc.) — write the planned list to
the session manifest before starting:

```bash
aida session manifest write --items SPEC-ID-1,SPEC-ID-2,SPEC-ID-3 \
  --source "user prompt"
```

This:
- Records each spec's position in the cluster + its status at plan time
- Renders a `[planned:by-<session>]` chip on those specs in other
  sessions' `aida queue list` output, so a concurrent reviewer/agent
  doesn't grab work you've claimed
- Powers `aida session show --plan` (✓ Done / ◐ In progress / ○ Pending
  status table) so you and the user can see cluster progress at a glance

Skip this step for single-item pickups (one spec, no batch intent) — the
manifest only earns its keep when there's a planned-cluster shape to
track.

### Step 3b: Mark the current item in-progress

Once the user confirms:

```bash
aida edit <spec_id> --status in-progress
```

This makes it visible to other sessions / dashboards that someone's on
it. If a session manifest exists (step 3a), `aida edit --status` also
stamps the manifest row's `started_at`, so the cluster's `◐ In progress`
column flips automatically.

### Step 3c: Render the spec card

Right after marking in-progress, render the picked-up spec as a boxed
card so its contract sits at the top of the terminal scrollback for the
whole working session — no separate `aida show` in another shell:

```bash
aida show <spec_id> --card
```

The card prints a header rule, the `id · type · priority · status`
one-liner, key fields (feature, tags, parent, related specs), the
description trimmed to its lead summary, the acceptance criteria, and
the git-linkage summary. The user can scroll up at any point to re-read
the goal, and can catch a mismatch between the spec and how you're
interpreting it early.

Pick the density to match the situation:

- **(default) balanced** — the boxed layout above; the normal pickup.
- **`--card --brief`** — a single-line `id · type · priority · status ·
  title` summary, no box. Use it in autonomous / `--auto-first` drains
  where the full card is more ceremony than the flow needs.
- **`--card --full`** — the complete description, no truncation. Use it
  when the spec is dense and every section is worth having in scrollback.

The full `aida show <spec_id>` stays the canonical detail view — the
card is a convenience snapshot, not a replacement. Reach for plain
`aida show` (or `--card --full`) whenever the trimmed summary isn't
enough. trace:TASK-265

### Step 3d: Headless design-fork gate (`AIDA_HEADLESS=1`) — trace:STORY-276

Under a headless `--no-human=both` drain there is no human to catch a wrong
guess in real time. Before writing any code, decide whether the spec presents
a **design-fork you cannot safely resolve** — and if so, punt it rather than
guess. Guessing past a fork produces a *silent wrong implementation*: it
compiles, the session ends green, and the wrong call surfaces only later.

**This step runs only when `AIDA_HEADLESS=1`** — the variable AIDA sets when
it launches a headless `claude -p` implementer. In an interactive pickup a
human is present: surface the fork to them and let them decide — do **not**
punt. Skip 3d entirely when the variable is empty.

```bash
echo "${AIDA_HEADLESS:-}"
```

- **Empty / unset** → interactive pickup. Skip 3d — implement normally.
- **`1`** → headless. Continue.

**What counts as a punt-worthy fork.** Re-read the spec, its `## Acceptance`
criteria, its parent, and any plan brief. Punt only when *all three* hold:

- **Two or more materially different valid implementations** exist, and the
  spec / acceptance / plan does not say which to pick.
- **Guessing wrong has real cost** — it shapes a public API, a data model, a
  user-facing behaviour, or something else expensive to undo later.
- You **cannot resolve it** from the spec, the codebase's existing
  conventions, or recorded project decisions.

Do **not** punt a fork you *can* resolve from context, a merely hard
implementation question, or a failing test / incidental bug (that is a
finding — Step 5b). Punting a resolvable fork adds triage noise; the bar is
"a human genuinely has to decide this."

**On a genuine fork: punt, do not guess.** Invoke `/aida-punt` — it
classifies the obstacle, runs `aida punt <spec_id> --category <cat> --reason
"…" [--lean "…"]`, and returns control. The spec flips to **Needs Attention**;
the `--auto-complete` orchestrator detects the punt, records it, and advances
to the next item; the advisor triages it later (`aida findings list`). Then
**stop** — do not implement, do not commit a guess, do not open a PR.

**No genuine fork → proceed to Step 4** and implement normally. The common
case is a clean spec that ships straight through headless.

### Step 3e: Resumed with an advisor answer (`AIDA_HEADLESS=1`) — trace:STORY-306

If this session **punted** on a design-fork (Step 3d) and is now being
*resumed* — the incoming message opens with `ADVISOR DECISION:` and names the
spec — the STORY-306 advisor tier has judged the fork. A decision has been
made; do **not** re-evaluate whether to punt.

1. Take the spec back out of Needs Attention:
   `aida edit <spec_id> --status in-progress`.
2. Apply the advisor's decision exactly as stated — it is the answer to the
   fork you punted on. (Under `--escalate-defaults` the "decision" instead
   authorizes the *defensible default*: proceed with your stated lean, or the
   most defensible reading of the spec.)
3. Implement, commit, and open the PR with `/aida-pr` — finish the spec.
4. **Do not punt again on the same fork.** One advisor round per spec: a
   re-punt is terminal — the drain stops the spec, no second advisor round.
   Punt again *only* if a genuinely new, distinct fork surfaces while
   applying the answer.

### Step 4: Do the work

Drive the actual implementation. Read the requirement (`aida show <spec_id>`),
follow related links, write the code, add trace comments
(`// trace:<spec_id> | ai:claude`), commit.

### Step 5: Mark done atomically

When the work lands:

```bash
aida queue done <spec_id>
```

This is one atomic step that:
- Sets status to **Done** (STORY-86: work finished on a branch, not yet
  merged to main). `aida pull` / `aida db sync --pull` automatically
  bumps `Done → Completed` once a commit referencing the spec lands on
  the default branch, so you don't need a second command after the PR
  merges.
- Removes the item from the queue
- Stamps the manifest row's `completed_at` (when a session manifest
  covers the current session) so `aida session show --plan` flips
  ✓ Done

Equivalent to: `aida edit <spec_id> --status done && aida queue remove <spec_id>`

`aida queue done` does **not** open the PR — Done means "finished on a
branch," and the PR is Step 6's job. The ordering (done → PR) is by design
(STORY-86), so Step 6 is mandatory, not optional: a spec left Done with no
PR is committed-but-unmergeable. When the branch has commits ahead of main
and no open PR, `queue done` now emits a workflow hint pointing at
`/aida-pr` — don't end the session until the PR is open. trace:BUG-232

**BUG-269**: `aida queue done` now *refuses* (exit 1) when the branch has
commits ahead of `origin/main` and `gh` confirms no open PR — the hint is
hardened into a gate so a session can't end with the spec marked Done
locally and the work unshipped. Open the PR first (Step 5c invokes
`/aida-pr` for exactly this reason), then re-run `aida queue done`. The
escape hatch is `aida queue done <spec> --force`, intended for the rare
case where the spec was implemented on a different branch already merged
(so the local branch has no PR by design). When `gh` is missing /
unauthenticated / unreachable, the gate falls through (it never asserts
"no PR" on guesswork); when the branch has no commits ahead (a no-op or
docs-only pickup), the gate also falls through. trace:BUG-269

### Step 5b: File conversational flags as draft TASKs (headless drain) — trace:STORY-285

Under a headless `--no-human` drain there is no human reading the
implementer's end-of-session prose in real time. The conversational flags an
implementer naturally raises at the end of a spec — a deviation from the
acceptance criteria, a non-obvious design call, a pre-existing bug spotted in
passing, a "could also do X" suggestion — would vanish into conversation
history the moment the orchestrator advances to phase 2. So the headless
implementer files them itself, as draft TASKs the advisor triages later via
`aida findings list` — the same surface the headless reviewer's findings land
on. This is the phase-1 mirror of `/aida-review` step 7b.

**This step runs only when `AIDA_HEADLESS=1`** — the variable AIDA sets when
it launches a headless `claude -p` implementer. In an interactive pickup a
human is present and reads the flags straight from the session; skip 5b
entirely.

```bash
echo "${AIDA_HEADLESS:-}"
```

- **Empty / unset** → interactive pickup. Skip 5b — the human reads the flags.
- **`1`** → headless. Continue.

**What counts as a finding.** A *finding* is a conversational flag worth the
advisor's attention later — not every incidental note. File these four kinds:

- `kind:deviation` — you deviated from the spec's acceptance criteria (give
  the reason). The advisor needs to know what shipped that the spec didn't
  ask for, or what it asked for that didn't ship.
- `kind:bug-spotted` — a pre-existing issue you found incidentally that is
  file-worthy in its own right (the kind of thing a watching human would
  route to a BUG).
- `kind:design-choice` — a non-obvious call you made *within* spec scope that
  the advisor should know shipped.
- `kind:followup-suggestion` — a concrete "could also do X" worth a TASK.

Do **not** file: mechanical choices obvious from the diff, restatements of
the spec, or anything a `git show` makes self-evident. When the spec went in
clean with nothing to flag, 5b files nothing — that is the common case.

**Idempotency — probe before filing.** A re-run of the implementer for the
same spec must not double-file. Check for findings already filed against this
spec (`--all` is required — a finding the advisor already promoted/dismissed
is terminal-status and hidden by default):

```bash
existing=$(aida list --tags "from-implementer:<SPEC-ID>" --all | grep -cE '^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+' || true)
```

If `existing` is non-zero, **skip the rest of 5b** — this spec's findings
were filed on an earlier run.

**File each finding** — one draft TASK apiece:

```bash
aida add --type task --status draft \
  --tags "from-implementer:<SPEC-ID>,kind:<deviation|design-choice|bug-spotted|followup-suggestion>,severity:<cosmetic|minor|major>" \
  --title "<one-line summary>" \
  --description-stdin <<'EOF'
<full flag text — what, where (file:line), why it matters>

Raised by the implementer while working <SPEC-ID>.
Branch: <branch>  ·  Commit: <SHA>  (PR link added on merge)
EOF
```

- **Always `--type task`** — even a bug-shaped finding. The advisor can
  `aida edit <ID> --type bug` on triage if warranted; the implementer does
  not expand the taxonomy.
- **`from-implementer:<SPEC-ID>`**, **`kind:<category>`**, and
  **`severity:<level>`** tags are all required. Add context tags freely.
- **Severity rubric:** `cosmetic` = nits; `minor` = a real but small gap;
  `major` = a design concern worth a conversation. When unsure, round down —
  the advisor re-grades on triage.
- The PR is not open yet at 5b time, so the description carries the branch +
  commit SHA; the advisor recovers the PR from the SHA. Capture each printed
  `<ID>` (e.g. `TASK-303`).

**Report what was filed.** Close the step with a one-line summary naming the
count and the TASK IDs — under TASK-307's tee this reaches the terminal, and
it lands in the headless JSONL either way:

```
Filed 2 implementer findings for <SPEC-ID>: TASK-303 (bug-spotted), TASK-304 (deviation)
```

If nothing was filed, say so: `No implementer findings filed for <SPEC-ID>.`

**The advisor picks these up** on its next session: `aida findings list`
surfaces them grouped under a *From implementer* section, `aida findings list
--source implementer` narrows to them, `aida findings list --kind bug-spotted`
isolates the file-worthy ones, `aida findings promote <ID>` sends one to the
work queue, `aida findings dismiss <ID>` rejects it. Both accept
`--reason "<text>"` so the rationale lands in the audit comment in one
command (TASK-404).

### Step 5c: Pre-exit checklist — the atomic shipping unit (TASK-401)

**Commit + push + PR + exit is the single atomic shipping unit. No partial
states under any mode.** Step 5 marked the spec Done locally; the work is
not *shipped* until a PR is open against `origin/main`. Before Step 6 may
render — and before any "what next?" framing reaches the operator — run a
three-part precondition check on the branch:

```bash
git fetch --quiet origin main 2>/dev/null || true
commits_ahead=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
pushed=$(git rev-parse --verify --quiet "origin/${branch}" >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  && [ "$(git rev-list --count "${branch}..origin/${branch}" 2>/dev/null || echo 1)" = "0" ] \
  && [ "$(git rev-list --count "origin/${branch}..${branch}" 2>/dev/null || echo 1)" = "0" ] \
  && echo yes || echo no)
pr_open=$(gh pr list --head "$branch" --json number --jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
```

- **`commits_ahead == 0`** → no work to ship; **skip 5c**, render Step 6
  normally. (Edge case: a docs-only or rebase-revert pickup that intentionally
  leaves the branch empty.)
- **`commits_ahead > 0` AND `pushed == yes` AND `pr_open >= 1`** → atomic
  shipping unit complete; render Step 6 normally.
- **Anything else** (commits exist and either not pushed or no PR open) → the
  branch is committed-but-unshipped. **Do not render Step 6 yet.** The only
  valid next move is `/aida-pr` — invoke it now and let it open the PR. Once
  `/aida-pr` returns with an open PR, *then* render Step 6.

The framing *"Want me to grab the next queue item or stop here?"* must only
fire AFTER the precondition is satisfied. A committed-but-unshipped exit is
the failure mode TASK-401 was filed against: the implementer's good work
sits on a local branch, the orchestrator can do nothing with it, and a
human has to recover it by hand.

**Headless mode (`AIDA_HEADLESS=1`): punt if `/aida-pr` cannot complete.**
Under an unattended drain there is no operator to fix a `gh auth` issue, a
push-permission denial, or a stale-base rebase prompt mid-`/aida-pr`. If
`/aida-pr` fails for *any* reason in headless mode, invoke `/aida-punt`
instead of exiting cleanly — the spec lands in Needs Attention with a
structured reason the advisor can triage, and the drain advances:

```bash
aida punt <SPEC-ID> --category other \
  --reason "work complete locally but unable to publish: <one-line cause from /aida-pr>" \
  --lean "<one-line — e.g. 'branch is ready; re-run /aida-pr after fixing <cause>'>"
```

Exiting cleanly with a local-only commit is **never** correct in headless
mode. The orchestrator's phase-1 `gh pr list --head <branch>` detector
catches the bare case (and emits `FailureKind::NoPr` with the resume hint
`aida queue work <SPEC> --resume <session>`), but the punt gives the advisor
the structured *why* — far more actionable than a bare "no PR opened."

Plain-text questions are the same invariant under headless mode. Do **not**
write "which path should I take?", "do you want option A or B?", or any
equivalent markdown question and then exit. If you cannot safely choose, run
`/aida-punt` with the decision fork, your recommended lean, and the evidence
you gathered. If you can safely choose, choose and ship. The orchestrator
also scans the final headless result for this text-question-and-exit ceiling
variant, but that is the safety net; the skill's exit path must prefer the
explicit punt.

**Interactive mode: this is still mandatory, just with a person in the
loop.** Surface the precondition state to the operator and proceed to
`/aida-pr` (do not ask "should I open the PR?" as a confirm — the rule is
not optional; only the *timing* is). If `/aida-pr` itself surfaces a
genuine design-fork (which base? which title?) the human resolves it. Once
the PR is open, fall through to Step 6.

### Step 6: Next steps (state-aware) — trace:TASK-87 trace:TASK-260

<!-- kind:confirmation -->
After step 5 succeeds **and Step 5c's pre-exit checklist passes** (commit
+ push + PR is the atomic shipping unit — never render this table while
the branch is committed-but-unshipped), surface a structured next-steps
table so the workflow self-guides instead of relying on improvised "want
me to push?" prompts. Don't auto-execute — the user picks.

When zen mode is corroborated (`aida zen status` = `zen`, STORY-287 /
BUG-237) this menu is a `kind:confirmation` prompt, but *which* row
auto-resolves depends on whether an orchestrator is present — `aida
orchestrator status` tells you (BUG-232):

- **`orchestrated`** — the *orchestrator mode* template applies; auto-take
  its `⇒` row (submit the PR) and the orchestrator drives phases 2-6.
- **plain `--zen`** (`aida zen status` = `zen`, `aida orchestrator status`
  = `interactive`) — auto-take the **primary `▶` row** of whichever
  template renders, with one carve-out: in the *simple mode, queue has
  more items* template do **NOT** auto-take `▶ Grab next item` — looping
  the queue unattended is `--auto-complete` / `--no-human` territory, not
  plain `--zen`; auto-take its `⇒ Wrap up what's shipped as a PR` row
  (`/aida-pr`) instead. For every other template the `▶` row IS the
  auto-take — including *simple mode, queue empty*, where `▶ Stop here`
  is the natural finish (Step 5c already opened the PR; nothing is
  queued). `/aida-pr`, when invoked, then surfaces the one genuine fork
  left — grab next vs stop — as its own `kind:design-fork` prompt. The
  *opening the PR is the mechanical step that must never be skipped*
  guarantee (BUG-232) is now Step 5c's job, not Step 6's: Step 5c
  hard-gates a committed-but-unshipped exit before this menu even renders.
- **default** (no zen) — render the table and let the user pick.

Still render the table first in every case — it stays the scrollback
record. Never auto-take a `⏸` row. Print the one-line `↳ zen:` note
naming the row taken. trace:BUG-232

**Detect state first.** These signals decide which template to render:

```bash
aida orchestrator status               # `orchestrated` → corroborated --auto-complete child
aida zen status                        # `zen` → corroborated zen mode (BUG-237)
aida session show --plan 2>/dev/null   # manifest rows + ✓/◐/○ status + `batch:` line
aida queue work --batch <NAME> --dry-run 2>/dev/null   # batch members still queued
aida queue next 2>/dev/null            # is there another item routed to this role?
aida session show 2>/dev/null | awk '/^Session /{print $2; exit}'   # session-id prefix
```

Check **orchestrator mode first of all** — it overrides every template
below. If `aida orchestrator status` printed `orchestrated`, this session
is a *corroborated* phase child of the `aida queue work --auto-complete`
orchestrator (STORY-246): `AIDA_AUTO_COMPLETE=1` is set AND its
`AIDA_AUTO_COMPLETE_TOKEN` names a live orchestrator run. The orchestrator
owns phases 2-6 (end session → wait CI → review → merge → pull → build); a
manual `/aida-pickup` or `aida session end` here would break the chain.
Render the *orchestrator mode* template and skip the batch / cluster /
simple detection entirely. **Do not** key this off the bare
`AIDA_AUTO_COMPLETE` env var — `aida orchestrator status` corroborates it
against the live run, so a stray or stale value cannot misfire orchestrator
mode (a hand-resumed session, for instance, prints `interactive`).
trace:TASK-286 trace:BUG-233

- **`aida orchestrator status` = `orchestrated`** → orchestrator mode (overrides all below)

Otherwise check **batch context** next — it takes precedence over the
manifest-row modes (a batch session's manifest carries only the head item
it picked up, so the cluster checks below would misfire on it):

- **`batch:` line present, `--batch <NAME> --dry-run` lists ≥1 queued
  member** → batch mode
- **`batch:` line present, dry-run lists none** → batch exhausted → the
  batch is done, so fall through to the *simple mode* templates and treat
  it like any single-spec pickup (TASK-272: when the batch empties, the
  menu reverts to the single-spec form)
- **Manifest exists, all rows ✓ Done** → cluster drained
- **Manifest exists, some ◐ / ○** → cluster partial (mid-drain)
- **No manifest** (single-item pickup) → simple mode

**Glyph convention** (consistent across `/aida-pickup`, `/aida-pr`,
`/aida-review`): `▶` = primary recommended action, `⇒` = alternative path,
`⏸` = pause/stop. Recommendations must be CONCRETE — name the command, name
the IDs. "You might want to consider…" is not a Next step. The *orchestrator
mode* template below uses `⇒` for its forward move (submit the PR → the
orchestrator continues) and the orchestrator-specific `⏏` (abort the
orchestrator chain) — because under `--auto-complete` the available moves
differ from the manual menu. trace:BUG-116

**Render multi-option prompts as a table.** When presenting 2+ paths
forward, render as a markdown table with columns Path / What happens / Why.
Use ▶ ⇒ ⏸ glyphs in the Path cell for the primary / alternate / pause
semantics. Emit it as a real GFM markdown table — *not* wrapped in a code
fence — so Claude Code's terminal draws the box-rule grid instead of raw
pipes. The **Why** column is load-bearing: it explains the role / lease /
worktree implication of each path, never just restates the action. A
single linear next-step stays a compact one-liner — the table is for 2+
options only. Full convention: `docs/skills-convention.md`.

**Apply the finish-state communication rubric (TASK-359).** Every template
below is finish-state communication, so it must carry all six rubric
elements: a **labelled State snapshot** preamble, the **deciding factor**
surfaced beside the options when one is in play, a **recommendation with
rationale** marked `← recommended` on the primary row, a **per-option
drain-state + reversibility** in the Why cell, an explicit **advise
escape** row (`⊕`) when an advisor seat is reachable, and **decoupled
followup-filing** — when a plan's `## Followups` section has unfiled
bullets, ask the filing question *after* the path is chosen, not bundled
into the path row. Full rubric:
`docs/aida/discipline/session-discipline.md` § *Finish-state
communication rubric*.

The preamble has a fixed shape, printed verbatim above the table:

```
State:
  Spec:    <SPEC-ID>  <title>            (Status: Done)
  Branch:  <branch>   <N> commits ahead of main   <pushed|local>
  PR:      <#N open: url>   |  no PR yet
  Drain:   phase 1/6 <interactive|--zen|--no-human=both>   orchestrator <on|off>
  Tests:   <last cargo test summary or "not run">
  Fmt:     <cargo fmt --check summary or "not run">
  Plan:    <docs/plans/...md>   |  none

Deciding factor: <one sentence — only when a load-bearing risk is in play>
```

Omit a row only when the data is genuinely absent (no PR yet → print "no
PR yet", don't drop the row). The **Deciding factor** line is conditional:
print it only when a real risk frames the choice (a smoke-gate, a plan
deviation, an unusually large change, mock-only subprocess plumbing).
When there is no deciding factor, omit the line entirely — silence
beats a vacuous *"none."*

**Recommendation rationale.** The `▶` row's Why cell must lead with the
*reason* this is the recommendation, not just the operational effect — one
sentence, then the lease / worktree implication. Mark the row
`▶ <action> ← recommended`. The user (or the standby advisor) reads the
rationale first; they read the alternative rows knowing what was passed
over and why.

**Advise escape.** When a checkpoint is genuinely ambiguous — competing
defensible paths, a risk the implementer cannot grade itself — add an
`⊕ Route to the advisor` row. The row's What cell is *"`/aida-advise
<SPEC-ID>` (today: copy the menu to the advisor seat; STORY-306's
advisor tier routes punts automatically)."* This is the rubric's `advise`
escape — a first-class option, not a fallback. Omit the row when the
recommendation is clear-cut and a relay would be busywork.

**Followup-filing is a separate prompt.** When the picked-up spec has a
plan file with a `## Followups` section and the auto-filer hasn't already
processed it (no `[aida:followups]` marker comment on the spec — TASK-96),
the filing question comes *after* the path table resolves, not bundled
into the path row. Render it as a second `kind:confirmation` prompt:

> File the N follow-ups from `<plan-file>` as child TASKs? [Y/n/per-bullet]

`aida queue done` already prompts per bullet in its non-auto-bump path;
the table above is for the case where you want to file before / outside
that auto-prompt (e.g. the auto-bump fired and you want to add a missed
bullet). Bundling filing into the path row is the failure mode the rubric
calls out — keep it sequential.

**Templates** (substitute `<session-id>`, `<cluster-id>`, `<NAME>`, etc.
from detection above). Each shows the State preamble, an optional
Deciding-factor line, a prose lead-in line, then the next-steps table —
print the lead-in as a normal sentence, then the table as a real GFM
markdown table (no surrounding code fence):

*Orchestrator mode (`aida orchestrator status` = `orchestrated`) — TASK-286:*

Print the State preamble first (substitute concrete values; omit rows
genuinely absent):

```
State:
  Spec:    <SPEC-ID>  <title>            (Status: Done)
  Branch:  <branch>   <N> commits ahead of main   <pushed|local>
  PR:      no PR yet (the `/aida-pr` row below opens it)
  Drain:   phase 1/6 <interactive|--zen|--no-human=both>   orchestrator on
  Tests:   <last cargo test summary or "not run">
  Fmt:     <cargo fmt --check summary or "not run">
  Plan:    <docs/plans/...md>   |  none
```

Then the Deciding-factor line *only when one is in play* (otherwise omit
entirely):

```
Deciding factor: <one sentence — e.g. "Implementation surfaced a
smoke-test gate the orchestrator can't grade on its own; worth routing
to the advisor before `/aida-pr` hands off to phases 2-6.">
```

✓ <SPEC-ID> done. This session runs under `--auto-complete` — the
orchestrator drives the rest.

Print the `ⓘ` note as a normal line above the table:

ⓘ Under `--auto-complete` the orchestrator handles phases 2-6 (end session
→ wait CI → review → merge → pull → build) automatically. The only correct
move here is to open the PR, then exit — a manual `/aida-pickup` or `aida
session end` would break the chain.

| Path | What happens | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| ⇒ Submit the PR ← recommended | `/aida-pr` | The orchestrator is already driving this spec — opening the PR is the only mechanical step that keeps the chain moving (phases 2-6 follow automatically). Reversible: closing the PR halts at phase 3. |
| ⊕ Route to the advisor *(include only when the deciding factor flags a risk the implementer cannot grade — omit the whole row otherwise)* | `/aida-advise <SPEC-ID>` — today: copy this menu to the advisor seat; STORY-306's tier routes punts automatically | When the implementation surfaced a load-bearing risk the implementer can't grade itself (smoke-test gate, deviation from the plan, larger-than-expected change), park the decision with the advisor instead of guessing the path forward. |
| ⏏ Abort the chain | Ctrl+C, then `aida session end <session-id> --force` from the parent shell | Hard-stops the orchestrator — ends this spec and bails; phases 2-6 will not run. Reversible: re-queue with `aida queue work <SPEC-ID>`. |

Orchestrator mode shows only these three rows on purpose: there is no
"grab the next item" (the orchestrator picks up the next spec only after
this one's *full* lifecycle completes, never mid-chain) and no plain
"stop here" (`aida session end` is the orchestrator's phase 2 — it runs
it for you, so a manual one would race it). The `⊕` row is the rubric's
advise escape (TASK-359): omit it when the recommendation is unambiguous
and a relay would be busywork; include it when the deciding factor above
the table flags a risk the implementer cannot grade. This template
overrides batch / cluster / simple mode — when `aida orchestrator
status` is `orchestrated`, render it and nothing else.
trace:TASK-286 trace:TASK-359 trace:TASK-393

**Graceful exit signal (TASK-329).** Under `$AIDA_ZEN`, `/aida-pickup`
auto-takes the `⇒ Submit the PR` row — it hands off to `/aida-pr`, which
drives the session to the open PR and *then* touches `$AIDA_EXIT_SENTINEL`
as the session's absolute last action so the orchestrator reaps the
otherwise-idle REPL. `/aida-pickup` itself must **not** touch the sentinel:
the hand-off target owns the exit, and a premature touch here would let the
orchestrator reap the session before `/aida-pr` opens the PR. The sentinel
is touched exactly once, by whichever skill performs the session's genuinely
last action. Full protocol: `docs/aida/discipline/skill-prompt-kinds.md`.
trace:TASK-329

*Batch mode (`batch:<NAME>` still has queued members) — TASK-272:*

Print the State preamble first (substitute concrete values; omit rows
genuinely absent, never leave a vague placeholder):

Then the Deciding-factor line *only when one is in play* (otherwise omit
entirely — silence beats a vacuous "none"):

```

API surface named in the plan brief; worth a human's eyes before more
cluster commits compound the decision.">
```

✓ <SPEC-ID> done. Batch `<NAME>` has <N> more queued (next: <NEXT-SPEC>).

| Path | What happens | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| ▶ Continue the batch ← recommended | `/aida-pickup --batch <NAME>` | The batch IS the consent record — cluster-mode continuation is the whole point: one branch + one PR for the batch, no re-entry cost. Same session + same lease; the next member accumulates as commits in this cluster. Reversible: Ctrl+D pauses; `aida queue work --batch <NAME>` resumes later. |
| ⇒ Wrap the batch as one PR | `/aida-pr` | Ships every batch member committed so far as a single cluster PR; the remaining queued members wait for a later session |
| ⇒ Pause the drain | Ctrl+D | Step out to test / debug; the batch marker is on the manifest — resume later with `aida queue work --batch <NAME>` from the parent shell |
| ⊕ Route to the advisor *(include only when the State snapshot or deciding factor flags a risk the implementer cannot grade — omit the whole row otherwise)* | `/aida-advise <SPEC-ID>` — today: copy this menu to the advisor seat; STORY-306's tier routes punts automatically | When the just-shipped batch member surfaced a load-bearing risk the implementer can't grade itself (an unexpected API change, a deviation from the batch plan, a scope realization), park the keep-draining-vs-pause call with the advisor before more cluster commits compound it. |
| ⏸ Ship just this spec, drop the batch | `/aida-pr`, then `aida session end <session-id>` from the parent shell | Solo PR for <SPEC-ID> only; abandons the rest of the batch — pick the remaining members up individually later |

The ▶/⇒ ordering is the point (TASK-272): cluster-mode continuation is
the *primary* option and the cluster PR is option 2 — ahead of the solo
PR-and-exit, which drops the batch. When the batch empties, use the
*simple mode* templates below instead (the menu reverts to single-spec
form).

rebase-revert pickup). The *committed-but-unshipped* state must not reach

**Rare bypass** (`commits_ahead > 0 AND pr_open == 0`): the implementer
should never see this here because Step 5c hard-gates it. If it does (a
Step-5c bug, a hand-resumed session that re-entered after a stale state),
recovery is to invoke `/aida-pr` once — opening the PR closes the atomic
shipping unit — *then* re-render this template, which is now in its
standard `pr_open >= 1` shape with `▶ Stop here` as the primary.

Print exactly one block — don't dump all six templates. In default mode,
don't auto-loop without confirmation: the user may want to break, review,
switch roles, or call it for the day. Under `$AIDA_ZEN` the user has
pre-authorized that loop — auto-take the primary row as described above.

Every template above (orchestrator, batch, cluster-drained, cluster-partial,
simple-more, simple-empty) carries the full finish-state rubric: a
**State preamble** block, an **optional Deciding-factor** line, a primary
row marked `← recommended` with rationale-first Why, and a conditional
`⊕ Route to the advisor` row. Each template stands on its own — a reader
skimming a single one sees the rubric applied, not just the upstream
prose pointing at it. trace:TASK-390 trace:TASK-359 trace:TASK-393 trace:TASK-413

## Discipline: the atomic shipping unit (TASK-401)

A spec is *worked* when its branch has the implementing commits. A spec is
*shipped* when those commits are pushed and a PR is open. The two are not
the same — and the `/aida-pickup` exit gate enforces it:

> **commit + push + PR + exit is the single atomic shipping unit; no
> partial states under any mode.**

The failure mode this rule prevents: a headless implementer that does
excellent work, marks the spec Done, writes a finish-state summary, and
closes its closing-question on the assumption a human will answer — then
exits cleanly with no push and no PR. The work is sitting on a local
branch the orchestrator cannot advance. The recovery is manual; the
drain's value collapses.

The rule is mode-independent on purpose. Interactive sessions can defer
the PR for *seconds* (e.g. step away from the keyboard, return to invoke
`/aida-pr`), but they cannot *exit* with the PR unopened — `/aida-pickup`
will not surface the "grab next item or stop here?" prompt until Step 5c
passes. Headless sessions take the same gate one stricter step: if
`/aida-pr` cannot complete, the spec is *punted* (`/aida-punt`) with a
structured *"unable to publish"* reason, not exited.

Pairs with:

- `aida queue done`'s built-in workflow hint (BUG-232): when the branch
  carries committed-but-unshipped work, it already nudges toward
  `/aida-pr`. Step 5c hardens that nudge into a gate.
- The orchestrator's phase-1 detector (`FailureKind::NoPr`): catches
  *any* implementer that exits with no PR, but only after the fact. The
  in-skill gate is the prevention; the orchestrator detector is the
  safety net.

## Producer side reminder

If the user complains the queue is always empty, gently remind them about
the advisor seat:

> The queue is filled by whoever wears the `advisor` role (the advisor seat)
> (`eval "$(aida role enter advisor)"`, then
> `aida queue add <id> --for implementer`).
> Want to switch hats and queue some work?

## Related skills / commands

- `aida role enter <name>` / `aida role list` — switch personas
- `aida queue list --all` — see the full queue including other-role items
- `aida queue add <id> --for <role> --note "..."` — route work
- `aida statusline` — confirm the active role + queue depth
- `/aida-rebase` — at session pickup, run `aida rebase --dry-run --json`
  to verify the branch isn't stale before diving in; the playbook in the
  `/aida-rebase` skill treats session pickup as an invocation trigger.

## Shell helper (for developers)

`aida role enter <name>` prints shell code; you must `eval` it for the role to
attach to the current shell. `aida dev shell-init --install` adds two helpers
(`aida-role` and `aida-off`) that wrap the eval, so you can type
`aida-role implementer` instead of `eval "$(aida role enter implementer)"`.
The helpers are convenience only — recommend the canonical `aida role enter`
form in user-facing instructions, since it works in every shell regardless of
whether the helpers are installed.
