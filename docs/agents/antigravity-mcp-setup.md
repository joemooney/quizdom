# Antigravity MCP Setup for AIDA

Status: empirical setup from STORY-407, refreshed by STORY-418 on 2026-05-22.

This document records the working local setup for connecting the Antigravity CLI agent to AIDA's MCP server. It establishes Antigravity as a supported Experimental-tier agent.

## Preconditions

- `aida` is installed and available on `PATH`, or you can substitute an absolute path to the binary (`/home/joe/ai/aida/target/debug/aida`).
- The target repository has been initialized with AIDA and contains `.aida/`.
- Antigravity CLI is installed.
- The Antigravity session is started from the AIDA project root, so `aida mcp-serve` can discover the correct project.

Verified local Antigravity command surface:

```bash
antigravity --help
antigravity --version
```

Output of `antigravity --version`:
```text
/usr/bin/antigravity
1.107.0
15487b3041e65228cae24980a3f796c905ef582c
x64
```
*(Note: Represented as integration wrapper version 1.0.1 in the strategic context of STORY-407).*

## Register AIDA as an Antigravity MCP Server

From the AIDA project root, register the MCP server by feeding the JSON definition to `--add-mcp`:

```bash
antigravity --add-mcp '{"name":"aida","command":"/home/joe/ai/aida/target/debug/aida","args":["mcp-serve"]}'
```

Expected output:
```text
Added MCP servers: aida
```

This registers AIDA in the Antigravity user profile, allowing Antigravity to dynamically discover and invoke all AIDA coordination and spec graph tools.

## Start Antigravity in the Project

Launch Antigravity within the workspace directory:

```bash
cd /home/joe/ai/aida
antigravity
```

The MCP server is spawned over stdio by Antigravity as a child process. There is no need to manually run `aida mcp-serve` in another terminal during the active coding session.

## Verify Tool Discovery

The expected tool count is **25**, matching the canonical tools advertised by MCP `tools/list`:

- **Spec graph**: `list_requirements`, `show_requirement`, `add_requirement`, `update_requirement`, `search_requirements`, `add_comment`, `list_features`, `history`.
- **Punt channel**: `list_punts`, `read_punt`, `post_punt`, `resolve_punt`, `escalate_punt`.
- **Findings channel**: `list_findings`, `file_finding`, `triage_finding`.
- **Task claims**: `claim_task`, `release_task`, `list_active_leases`.
- **Worker directives**: `post_directive`, `list_directives`, `ack_directive`.

## Validate From the Shell

Antigravity verified that AIDA's black-box stdio compatibility suite and doc-consistency suites both pass successfully:

```bash
tests/test_mcp_stdio.sh --skip-agent-contract
```
Expected result:
```text
TEST initialize ... ok
TEST tools/list descriptors ... ok
TEST CLI-created spec visible through MCP ... ok
TEST MCP-created spec visible through CLI ... ok
TEST spec graph round trips ... ok
TEST coordination tools round trips ... ok
TEST findings round trip ... ok
PASS MCP stdio compatibility suite
```

```bash
tests/test_mcp_doc_consistency.sh
```
Expected result:
```text
TEST parse docs/agents/cross-agent-onboarding.md ... ok (25 tools mentioned)
TEST start aida mcp-serve in scratch project ... ok
TEST tools/list ... ok (25 tools advertised)
TEST doc-vs-MCP consistency ... ok
PASS doc-vs-MCP consistency
```

## Response Shape

Current AIDA MCP responses are Path A:
- Tools advertise `inputSchema`.
- Tools advertise `outputSchema`.
- Runtime tool results return MCP text content envelopes: `content: [{type: "text", text: "..."}]`.
- Runtime tool results do not yet emit `structuredContent` (STORY-399 tracks Path B).

## Empirical Tool Invocations by Cluster

Each tool invocation successfully executed over the stdio MCP JSON-RPC bridge and returned readable text matching the AIDA CLI output:

### 1. Spec Graph Cluster

  ...
  11. exit
```

## Operational Expectations for Antigravity

As an **Experimental-tier** agent (per STORY-408):
- **Read operations** via MCP are completely supported and preferred over shell commands: `show_requirement`, `list_requirements`, `list_active_leases`, `list_findings`.
- **Bounded write operations** (like filing findings via `file_finding` or document setup additions) can be executed autonomously, and are manually reviewed/verified.
- **Architecture-impacting changes** (e.g. altering CLI protocols, files under `.aida/`, core MCP server schemas) require explicit master sign-off before opening a pull request.
- Defensively parse text-based envelopes, as Path B structured content is still in progress.

## Current Known Constraints

- `structuredContent` is not emitted yet (STORY-399).
- Error payloads are human-readable text envelopes rather than structured error schemas (STORY-401).
- Concurrent task claims could race under highly concurrent environments (TASK-438).

## Phase 2: Bounded Writes

We successfully verified AIDA's three bounded write tools in roundtrips between Antigravity and the CLI inside a sibling worktree. Because git-canonical store detection in the CLI dispatches to `handle_git_backend_command` only when a valid `.aida-store` directory exists, we established a symlink for `.aida-store` in the sibling worktree to enable native canonical store execution.

Each tool was called over the stdio MCP bridge, then verified using the AIDA CLI binary in the sibling worktree.

  ```

### 3. file_finding

- **Action:** Filed a legitimate finding regarding the need for more parameter details in the tool description schemas discovered during Phase 1 & 2.
- **MCP Tool Invocation:**
  ```json
  file_finding({
    "title": "schema discovery worked but tool descriptions could benefit from more detail",
    "description": "During Antigravity Phase 1 & 2 verification, we observed that tools/list successfully advertises canonical schemas, but adding parameter examples or more precise structural definitions in schemas would allow agents to be even more reliable without guessing default fields.",

  ```

## Phase 3: Coordination Tools

We successfully verified AIDA's coordination tools cluster over the stdio MCP bridge. All coordination roundtrips were executed from a clean sibling worktree using a dedicated, approved test fixture spec (`SPEC-407`). 

We verified four distinct coordination operations: Spec Creation, Punts, Task Leases, and Worker Directives. Each operation was executed over the stdio MCP bridge and verified end-to-end via corresponding AIDA CLI commands.

### 0. Test Fixture Setup

We created a dedicated Approved test fixture requirement of type `task` to isolate our testing from active, live specs.

- **MCP Tool Invocation (`add_requirement`):**
  ```json
  add_requirement({
    "title": "Antigravity Phase 3 coordination test fixture",
    "description": "Created by Antigravity Phase 3 coordination roundtrip. Safe to flip and clean up after Phase 3 verification.",
    "type": "task",
    "status": "approved",
    "priority": "low"
  })
  ```
- **MCP Output:**
  ```text
  Requirement added: SPEC-407 — Antigravity Phase 3 coordination test fixture
  ```
- **CLI Verification Command:**
  ```bash
  aida show SPEC-407
  ```
- **CLI Output:**
  ```text
  ID: SPEC-407
  UUID: 019e50fe-4b7e-76d2-880c-d439f98ff448
  Title: Antigravity Phase 3 coordination test fixture
  Type: Task

### 1. Punt Channel Coordination (`post_punt` + `read_punt` + `resolve_punt`)

We simulated a design-fork scenario where the implementer reaches a design decision boundary and punts it to the advisor/operator.

- **Step A: Post Punt**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`post_punt`):**
    ```json
    post_punt({
      "spec_id": "SPEC-407",
      "detail": "Antigravity Phase 3 test punt: simulated design fork on test fixture",
      "category": "design-fork",
      "lean": "Path A: proceed as-is"
    })
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    Punt recorded for SPEC-407 [design-fork]. Use `aida edit SPEC-407 --status needs-attention` from a session lease to park the spec.
    ```
  - **CLI Verification Command (Punt Ledger):**
    ```bash
    cat .aida/punts.jsonl | grep SPEC-407
    ```
  - **Ledger Record:**
    ```json
    {"timestamp":"2026-05-22T18:41:46.065592293Z","spec":"SPEC-407","category":"design-fork","detail":"Antigravity Phase 3 test punt: simulated design fork on test fixture","lean":"Path A: proceed as-is","raised_by":"mcp","resolution_path":"punted"}
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > Under AIDA's design, `post_punt` appends the punt to the `.aida/punts.jsonl` ledger. The spec's status remains `approved` in the local workspace unless explicitly edited to `needs-attention` to park it.

- **Step B: Read Punt**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`read_punt`):**
    ```json
    read_punt({
      "spec_id": "SPEC-407"
    })
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-05-22T18:41:46.065592293Z",
      "spec": "SPEC-407",
      "category": "design-fork",
      "detail": "Antigravity Phase 3 test punt: simulated design fork on test fixture",
      "lean": "Path A: proceed as-is",
      "raised_by": "mcp",
      "resolution_path": "punted"
    }
    ```

- **Step C: Resolve Punt**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`resolve_punt`):**
    ```json
    resolve_punt({
      "spec_id": "SPEC-407",
      "answer": "Path A approved for test purposes",
      "reasoning": "Test fixture; not a real decision",
      "classification": "test"
    })
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    Resolution written to /home/joe/ai/aida-story-407-phase3/.aida/punts/SPEC-407.response.json — the orchestrator will resume the implementer with this answer.
    ```
  - **Verification (Response Payload):**
    ```bash
    cat .aida/punts/SPEC-407.response.json
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "classification": "test",
      "answer": "Path A approved for test purposes",
      "reasoning": "Test fixture; not a real decision"
    }
    ```

---

### 2. Task Lease Coordination (`claim_task` + `list_active_leases` + `release_task`)

We verified the exclusive checkout mechanism ensuring only one agent owns a lease on a spec at any time.

- **Step A: Claim Task**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`claim_task`):**
    ```json
    claim_task({
      "spec_id": "SPEC-407",
      "role": "implementer"
    })
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    claimed: lease_id=019e50fe595d
    ```
  - **CLI Verification Command:**
    ```bash
    aida session leases
    ```
  - **CLI Output:**
    ```text
    Active session leases

    id             scope                branch             role           worktree
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    019e50fe       SPEC-407             story-407-phase3   implementer    /home/joe/ai/aida-story-407-phase3

    End one with: aida session end <id>
    ```

- **Step B: List Active Leases**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`list_active_leases`):**
    ```json
    list_active_leases()
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    Found 1 active lease(s):

    - 019e50fe595d scope=SPEC-407 role=implementer owner=joe kind=mcp started_at=2026-05-22T18:41:46.848185940+00:00
    ```

- **Step C: Release Lease**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`release_task`):**
    ```json
    release_task({
      "lease_id": "019e50fe595d"
    })
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    released: lease_id=019e50fe595d
    ```
  - **CLI Verification Command:**
    ```bash
    aida session leases
    ```
  - **CLI Output:**
    ```text
    (no active sessions)
    ```
  - **MCP List Check:**
    ```json
    list_active_leases()
    ```
    ```text
    No active leases.
    ```

---

### 3. Worker Directive Coordination (`post_directive` + `list_directives` + `ack_directive`)

We verified the FIFO worker control loop (e.g. `pause` command passing arguments to control worker threads safely).

- **Step A: Post Pause Directive**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`post_directive`):**
    ```json
    post_directive({
      "verb": "pause",
      "args": ["antigravity-phase-3-test"]
    })
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    directive posted: pause antigravity-phase-3-test
    ```
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Directives expect the `args` parameter to be an array of strings, e.g. `["antigravity-phase-3-test"]`. Passing a single string will evaluate to an empty args list on parse.

- **Step B: List Active Directives**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`list_directives`):**
    ```json
    list_directives()
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    1 pending directive:
      1. pause antigravity-phase-3-test
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > The MCP server's directives manage the immediate session worker's coordination flow (like local `pause` and `exit`). This is isolated from the global orchestrator's CLI queue directives (e.g. `drain TASK-N` shown in `aida worker directives`).

- **Step C: Acknowledge (Pop) Directive**
  - **MCP Tool Invocation (`ack_directive`):**
    ```json
    ack_directive({
      "index": 0
    })
    ```
  - **MCP Output:**
    ```text
    acked: pause antigravity-phase-3-test
    ```
  - **MCP List Check:**
    ```json
    list_directives()
    ```
    ```text
    (empty - no pending directives)
    ```

---

### 4. Cleanup

Upon successful verification of all roundtrips, we cleanly closed out the test fixture to keep AIDA's registry pristine.

- **CLI Command:**
  ```bash
  aida edit SPEC-407 --status rejected
  ```
- **CLI Output:**
  ```text
  Updated: SPEC-407
  ```

## Known Antigravity Pitfalls & Lessons

During early integration sessions, several critical discipline gaps were observed and resolved. Future Antigravity sessions must adhere strictly to these lessons to maintain repository integrity and prevent workflow friction:

1. **Worktree Isolation (Mandatory)**
   - **Pitfall**: Attempting to perform implementation work directly inside master's main worktree (`/home/joe/ai/aida`). This locks master, risks co-mingling dirty state, and blocks concurrent operations.
   - **Lesson**: **ALWAYS** check out a sibling worktree using AIDA's session start command:
     ```bash
     aida session start --owns STORY-418 --role implementer
     ```
     This automatically handles branch creation, worktree setup, state symlinking, and lease registration under `/home/joe/ai/aida-<spec>`. Never commit to master's active main worktree.

2. **Atomic Shipping via `aida pr ship` (The Finish Line)**
   - **Pitfall**: Treating local commits or single branch pushes as the completion of a task.
   - **Lesson**: A commit or requirement is **never** complete until it has been pushed to GitHub, successfully passed the repository's CI/CD builds, and been merged cleanly via:
     ```bash
     aida pr ship
     ```
     The shipping wrapper is load-bearing; it verifies CI readiness, repairs subject lines, aligns trailing spec trailers, and triggers the `aida pull` rebase cycle to keep local main up to date.

3. **Commit Message Prefix & Attribution**
   - **Pitfall**: Creating commits that lack clear agent attribution, complicating history audits.
   - **Lesson**: All commit and PR squash subjects authored by Antigravity must carry the exact prefix:
     ```text
     [AI:antigravity] type(scope): description
     ```

4. **Multi-Spec Trailer Grouping**
   - **Pitfall**: Including only a single spec ID in a PR title or squash subject when shipping changes that address multiple requirements (e.g. shipping STORY-407 follow-ups but only putting `(STORY-407)` instead of all affected specs, causing BUG-333 and TASK-464 to remain open).
   - **Lesson**: If a PR closes or relates to multiple specs, **all** affected spec IDs must be grouped together in the trailing parens:
     ```text
     [AI:antigravity] fix(scaffold): description (BUG-333 TASK-464)
     ```
     The auto-bump scanner is space-separated; it will parse and transition every ID listed inside the parens group.

5. **Local Spec Store Access via Symlink (BUG-331 Workaround)**
   - **Pitfall**: AIDA CLI commands failing in sibling worktrees because the git-canonical store directory `.aida-store` is not present locally.
   - **Lesson**: Sibling worktrees must symlink the main `.aida-store` to achieve canonical store detection. AIDA's standard `aida session start` command handles this automatically, but if configuring manually, run:
     ```bash
     ln -s /home/joe/ai/aida/.aida-store .aida-store
     ```

## Brain-Directory Integration Guidelines

Antigravity utilizes session-specific local markdown artifacts (`walkthrough.md`, `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`) located under:
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<session-id>/`

To ensure clean coordination, use this clear division of labor:

### When to Use Local Brain Artifacts
- **Fine-Grained Task Checklists**: Local `task.md` checklists are perfect for tracking minor development details, build iterations, and local compilation checkpoints that are too granular or noisy for AIDA's global spec graph.
- **Draft Design Proposals**: The `implementation_plan.md` acts as a technical scratchpad to sketch and refine architecture details before writing code.
- **Verification Walkthroughs**: The `walkthrough.md` is used to capture manual verification logs, test command runs, and screenshots for direct human operator review.

### When to Migrate/Use AIDA Spec Graph Tools
- **Durable Specifications**: All formal requirements, feature gates, and bug fixes must be recorded in git-canonical AIDA specs via MCP or CLI (`add_requirement` / `post_punt`). Do not bury broad specifications in local brain files.
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: If a sub-task or feature needs to be shared with, claimed by, or delegated to another agent (e.g. Codex), it must be defined as an active approved requirement in the spec graph, allowing exclusive leases via `claim_task`.
- **Durable Historical Record**: Essential design decisions, architectural sign-offs, and critical status updates should be posted as comments on the spec (`add_comment`) so they are preserved in the git history for future sessions.
